# Projectile Motion Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the maximum height and horizontal distance of a projectile based on user-input angle and velocity.
It uses Machine Learning (Linear Regression) and visualizes the projectile’s motion with a graph.
## Features
- Predict maximum height and landing distance of a projectile
- User can input any angle (degrees) and velocity (m/s)
- Visualizes the projectile motion as a graph
- Compares ML predictions with physics-based calculations
## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
## How to Run
- Click on Untitled0.ipynb
- Open on colab
- Run the code
- Enter the angle then the velocity
